    <h2>How ZipShip Works</h2>
    <p style="font-size:20px">A Traveler can post his trip from anywhere in the world to Pakistan and the Shopper from Pakistan can see the trip on ZipShip(our software). Shopper asks the Travler to take his/her required item from the country he/she is travelling from. Traveler can select the orders of Shoppers, also can remove it! Travler can choose the order of any Shopper. Shopper gives money to ZipShip in Pakistan and ZipShip assures the Traveler to shop the item independently with his/her money as the Shopper has given the amount! When the Traveller arrives Pakistan, ZipShip will arrange a meet-up for them or the Traveler gives the item to ZipShip and we then deliver the item to the Shopper! </p>
